  <p name-url-slot><a href='https://augury.rangle.io/pages/guides/augury.html'>augury, a debugging/profiling/... tool for Angular 2</a></p>
  <p aliveness-slot>Seems dead. Couldnt get it to work in Firefox and apparently it was removed by google from the Chrome store from some reason https://github.com/rangle/augury/issues/1507</p>
  <p usability-slot>NA</p>
  <p rating-slot>Looks really good, but no longer officially available</p>
  <p other-slot>
    In the thread linked in the aliveness category, some posted a link to "Angular DevTools", an official dev tools plugin, but the functionality of that one seems a lot more restricted: https://angular.io/guide/devtools#:~:text=Angular%20DevTools%20is%20a%20browser,supports%20Angular%20v12%20and%20later.
