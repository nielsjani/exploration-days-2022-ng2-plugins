  <p aliveness-slot>Active on github issues & pushing new code + recently released new version on npm </p>
  <p usability-slot><a href='https://valor-software.com/ng2-charts/#PieChart'>Examples</a> + some minor 'General' info. This library is a wrapper around chart.js, so if you have questions, you often need to go looking at chart.js (stackoverflow posts) and try to map their fix to the wrapper-implementation of ng2-charts</p>
  <p rating-slot>Seems like an ok solution for simple charts</p>
  <p other-slot>
    <b>Why this library?</b>
    Initially looked at <a href='https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-charts'>swimlane/ngx-charts</a> but that one hasn't had a release for 4 months and > 600 open Github issues.
    There also was no 'real' documentation, just some code examples for each chart type. # weekly downloads wasn't too bad at +-130K, but ng2-charts sits at +-180K, has had a release last month and 'only' 120-ish open Github issues
